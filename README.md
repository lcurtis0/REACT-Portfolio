# REACT-Portfolio

# Description

This files are created to complete the Module 20 challenge-20

The goal of this app is to show my bio and porfolio to people want to know more about me. 

This is so that to understand more about my self I can send a link to this site

I learned that REACT is a very effective tool for constructing sites both front end and back end. üêö ü¶Ä üê†
